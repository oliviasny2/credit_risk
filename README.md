## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide good machine learning models to predict good and bad credit risk loans. To do this, we are using over- and under-sampling methods to gather relevant data on bad credit risks - because they are not as prevalent as the good credit risks - in order to train the algorithm to more accurately predict bad credit risks
